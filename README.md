If you just pull index.html into the browser, you wont be able to load the account balances via the ajax calls placed in the javascript of the page. Instead,

Start a web server in the top level directory of the project to serve index.html.  On a mac, this is as simple as:

python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

in the top level of the project directory.  Then you can simply browse to:

loachost:8000
